# Apollo-s-path
Python simulation and animation of the space shuttle going to the Moon. It's a good example of how to set up differential 
equations in python, Astrodynamics and Python Animations. I set it up to work in Python 3.6.2, and it needs scipy 1.1.0, numpy 1.15.1 and 
Matplotlib 2.2.3, which shouldn't be any trouble.
